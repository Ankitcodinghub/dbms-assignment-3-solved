There are 16 Question Sets each containing 10 queries. Sets are numbered as SET A, SET B, â€¦, SET P. The questions within each set are numbered as 0, 1, 2, .., 9. You will have to answer 10 queries, one from each of the 10 sets assigned to you. We have uploaded a document that tells your assignment of roll number to sets. For the assigned sets, you have to answer the same question number. The question number within a set you have to answer is the same as the last digit of your roll number.

Suppose you have been assigned the 10 sets SET A, SET B, SET D, SET F, SETG, SET H, SET K, SET L, SET M, SET P and your roll number ends in 5. Then, you have to answer the question with serial number 5 for each of these 10 sets.

HINT: It might be a good idea to first take a look at the set assignment and then mark your questions in the pdf file corresponding to your roll number.

A database schema and the sets of questions are given below.

You have to write your SQLs in a single text file and submit through Moodle (Name it as Lab4_&lt;Roll_no&gt;.txt). The first few lines of the file should have your roll number and name and also the sets assigned to you. Also, you must write before each SQL, the &lt;set number&gt;.&lt;query number&gt;. For example, suppose your roll no. is 19CS10005 and your name is ABC DEF and you have been assigned the above sets. Your submission file should look like this:

File name: Lab4_19CS10005.txt

18CS10005 ABC DEF

SET A, SET B, SET D, SET F, SET G, SET H, SET K, SET L, SET M, SET P

<pre>A.5
Select ....
B.5
Select...
D.5
Not answered
.....
</pre>
Note: For each question, you have to write a single SQL query which can have any number of sub- queries. You cannot split it into separate queries, views, etc. It is important that you use exactly the same table and column names as given in the question. Otherwise, there will be mismatch during evaluation and you will lose marks. For any query, you may write any assumption that you make. It will be considered only if the assumption is found to be reasonable.
